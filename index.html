    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Hi! I’m Myra,</strong> a first-generation college student graduating from Stony Brook University in Spring 2025.</p>
      
      <p>I am creating <strong>FirstGen Forward</strong> (starting with this website) to help other first-gen students discover resources that can help them gain professional experience. Some of these tools I have personally used, and others I learned about through LinkedIn or by talking to people who found them helpful.</p>
      
      <p>Everything I am sharing is based on my own experience and the resources I wish I had known about earlier in my career journey. For context, I come from a STEM background.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Important note:</strong> I am not a career coach or an advisor. I am simply sharing what has helped me and what I have learned along the way. Please take what resonates with you and always do your own research.</p>
      
      <p>I hope you find something helpful here. Feel free to reach out through the contact form at the bottom of this page. I would love to hear from you!</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Do Not Let Cost Stop You</h3>
