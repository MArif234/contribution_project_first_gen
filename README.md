# Contribution Project: FirstGen Forward
FirstGen Forward is a digital resource hub built to empower first-generation college students by making professional development opportunities more accessible and actionable.

This project was initiated as part of the Cornell Contribution Project with a mission to bridge the information gap for students who may not have access to mentorship, institutional guidance, or networks.

🌐 Project Overview

FirstGen Forward is currently a website that curates resources and guidance on:

✅ Finding and funding conference opportunities

✅ Securing internships, externships, and fellowships

✅ Exploring micro-internships and volunteer opportunities

✅ Using LinkedIn effectively to build your professional brand

This tool was created by a first-generation student, for first-generation students, with the aim of making professional development more inclusive and transparent.

🧠 Vision for the Future

Down the line, FirstGen Forward will evolve into an AI-powered assistant that can help students:

✅ Discover personalized career-building opportunities

✅ Get real-time advice on resume building and networking

✅ Automatically match with internships and funding based on their background

✅ Navigate platforms like LinkedIn, Handshake, and school job boards more effectively
